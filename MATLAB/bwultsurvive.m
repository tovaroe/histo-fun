%BWULTSURVIVE returns a binary image
%
%    output = bwultsurvive(bw, st, minNeighbors) uses the bwsurvive
%    function to filter out positive pixels in bw that do not have at least
%    minNeighbors in the neighborhood given by the strel st repeatedly 
%    until arriving at a stable final binary image.
