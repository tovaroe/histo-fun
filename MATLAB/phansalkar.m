function I_t = phansalkar(I, varargin)
%PHANSALKAR returns a thresholded (binary) image
%
%    I_t = phansalkar(IM, VARARGIN) performs phansalkar thresholding [1] of 
%    the input image IM and returns the thresholded (binary) image.
%
%OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
% are the parameters radius, k, r, p, q (given in this exact order as input 
% arguments) as described in the ImageJ/Fiji implementation (see 
% https://imagej.net/Auto_Local_Threshold).
%
% [1] Based on Phansalkar, Neerad, et al. "Adaptive local thresholding for 
% detection of nuclei in diversity stained cytology images." Communications
% and Signal Processing (ICCSP), 2011 International Conference on. IEEE, 
% 2011.
% Strongly inspired by the ImageJ implementation.
