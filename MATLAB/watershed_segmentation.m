function I = watershed_segmentation(I, varargin)
%WATERSHED_SEGMENTATION return a binary image with split cells
%
%   I = watershed_segmentation(I) used the watershed algorithm [1] to
%   split closely adjacent cells (blobs) in the input image I.
%
%   I = watershed_segmentation(I, sigma) uses the given sigma for the
%   gauss-filtering (i.e., higher values for sigma perform less aggressive
%   splits).
